# Sabres Goal Lamp Code

I am by no means a software engineer and there are definitly more efficient ways to do this but I wanted to make it available to anyone that wanted to try it out. This code will update every morning to check if there is a Buffalo Sabres game and wait until the game starts. Then when the Sabres score a goal the goal scorers goal song will play. This is version one of this code and in the future I plan to update it to include hardware support. 

It uses the NHL api and is about 30 seconds behind cable but I think I have it as close as it can be as I poll the api as often as allowed by the NHL.
